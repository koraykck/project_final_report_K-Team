# Project Topic
Analyzing the clean water resources and access of clean water data of the countries and to examine this results in terms of mortality rates and the economic situation of countries.Thus make inferences about the clean water situation in the world.
# Goals
To find out
- Clean water access sitution around the world.
- What is the clean water sources and status of countries and how does this affect them?
- Does the economic situation have an impact on access to clean water?
- how death rates differ in countries without access to clean water?
---
# Societal benefits
- To show people the situation of clean water access.
- Point out the dangers we face and find action to take

# About Data
## Main Data sets:
- WASH data set from Unicef and WHO.
- Water resource data set from CDP.

## Other Data Sets:
- Mortality rates data from worldbank
- GDP data set from worldbank

## Challenges
- WASH data set is complicated.
- Water resources data set is so precious but needs advanced analysis.
- Not enough experience for that much data.
---
## Conclusions
- At least one out of every four people has problems in accessing drinking water and about 12 percent of those people do not even have a basic access to water which means they have to spend more than 30 minutes to drink or use clean water.
- The biggest problem facing our clean water resources is drought and poor quality water.
- There is a huge correlation between water access and economy.
- Not having clean water might causes more death.
