Earlier streamflow timing could affect rafting and fishing. Changes in reservoir storage could affect recreation on-site and downstream. Declining snowpacks could impact winter mountain recreation and tourism.

Uneven rain regimens could mean water scarcity in summer months. Water distribution in the metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro is heavily dependent on electricity, as must of the potable water comes from the Guandu River, outside the city's borders. Blackouts already cause interference with distribution, sometimes affecting the end of the pipe lines for two or three consecutive days. 
The matter is more serious because Brazil's energy is highly dependent on hydroelectric power, a source that depends heavily on rainfall. During the summer of 2014 some reservoirs were at really low capacity, thus raising speculation in the federal government whether a rationing policy would have to be implemented. In such cases, water distribution is prioritized. However, in the medium-term, there are risks associated with a widespread energy scarcity. Energy supply and transmission are national issues, and the energy distribution in the city of Rio de Janeiro is provided by Light, a private company regulated by the state government. 
The Guandu reservoir is fed by the Paraíba do Sul river, whose waters are shared with the state of São Paulo and Minas Gerais. Current drought in São Paulo is putting pressure that Rio de Janeiro diverts some of Paraíba do Sul´s water for São Paulo, which would potentially cause water scarcity within the state of Rio, affecting agriculture and food security.",6498837,2016,"(-22.9054389, -43.5614471)","(-14.235004, -51.92528)"

Buncombe County is one of the driest counties in North Carolina, receiving only about 40 inches of rain per
year. This low rainfall, coupled with the lack of any viable regional aquifer that could be used for well waters,
makes the City of Asheville’s exposure to drought very high.
VULNERABILITY
The City built adaptive capacity by adding two supply points in addition to North Fork Reservoir, reducing its
overall vulnerability to drought and disruption of supply. Therefore, the vulnerability of water supply is medium.
RISK
Climate projections indicate that drought will continue to be a major threat to the City of Asheville. As demand
on the city’s water supply continues to grow, the threat of water shortage will increase, making the risk

For the Greensville Rural Settlement Area we completed a detailed Water Budget as the assessment of the source revealed a high degree of stress within the subwatershed and shown that under drought conditions of (only) 2 years the shallow wells can experience a drop in water levels of 7m. This drop is considered significant as some of the residential wells do not have a great water column available or the well cannot be operated at very low water levels. 
Also an increase in extreme weather events is expected to increase flooding and soil erosion. This will result in degraded surface water quality due to the suspension of sediments, nutrients and pesticides.",550700,2015,"(43.250021, -79.866091)","(56.130366, -106.346771)"

43928,Canberra,Canberra,Australia,South Asia and Oceania,Public,,2017,Increased water stress or scarcity,Long-term,Serious,"The water resources and water consumption of the ACT region are highly influenced by climate variability.  The spatial and temporal variability of temperature, evaporation and rainfall largely determine the level of urban water supply security (i.e. reliability). Future climate scenarios are fundamental to the level of the ACT’s future water security. This was evident when South-eastern Australia experienced 7 years of severe drought between 2002 and 2009. The duration and impacts of this ""Millennium Drought"" were unprecedented in the ACT’s historical climatic record since Federation. For one year in 2006 stream flows reduced to 90% but averaged around 60%, and water storages fell to low levels (approximately  30% of capacity), and severe water restrictions (Stage 3) were imposed for almost 4.5 years across the period 2003 to 2010. Stage 4 restrictions which require no outside watering were nearly enacted however a storm in 2007 averted this stage. Additionally, the light soaking autumn rainfall has decreased significantly, with an almost 40% reduction observed over the period 1997 to 2010 as compared to the long term average. Over the same period, spring and summer rainfalls have increased however these are delivered as intense and localised storms. This change continued through the 2010/2011 wet years. Considering the lessons from the Millennium Drought and the changing seasonality of rainfall, there are expected to remain long-term water related risks as a result of increasing population growth combined with periods of reduced rainfall. If climate emerges drier than projected it will further compromise the ACT’s water supply security. The likelihood to this scenario happening is ‘Possible’ and would lead to ‘Major’ to ‘Severe’ consequences, such as the water supply system not able to meet the ACT’s unrestricted demand for water.",400000,2016,"(-35.3075, 149.1244)","(-25.274398, 133.775136)"

EXPOSURE
Seventy percent of the local drinking water supply is provided by the North Fork Reservoir. The dam and
associated infrastructure provides the reservoir’s holding capacity. Past flood events and related erosion have
shown the dam to be exposed to extreme precipitation and flooding events.
VULNERABILITY
The construction of the dam over 60 years ago was sufficient at the time, but an increased demand for water
and a greater exposure to possible dam breach has now made vulnerability high.
RISK
The consequence of a dam breach is very high. The resulting flood would approximate a 500-year flood, with
high velocity and the potential to cause massive damage downstream. This possibility, coupled with the impact
of loss of drinking water for a substantial period of time, makes this a high risk.",87882,2014,"(35.5951, -82.5515)","(37.09024, -95.712891)"

Currently, about 20 - 30% of freshwater water supply in Hong Kong comes from the local catchment and the remaining 70% to 80% is imported from Dongjiang (DJ) in Guangdong Province under a ""Package deal lump sum"" agreement, based on which an annual lump sum payment is made to the Guangdong authorities in exchange for a reliable and flexible supply of DJ water up to an annual supply ceiling of 820 million m3. Besides, 1,100 million m3 has been allocated and reserved for Hong Kong to meet its long term needs. 
Since 1950s, Water Supplies Department has been supplying seawater for toilet flushing. Currently, the network has covered about 85% of the population in Hong Kong. It saves about 270 million m3 of freshwater every year. 
With this three-pronged water supply system, we should be able to maintain the reliability level of water supply in Hong Kong not lower than 99% in the short to medium term. 
In the long-run, the water resources and security in Hong Kong face a number of uncertainties descripted in the Risk Description below.
Serious - 
Hong Kong is an international city. Reliable water supply is essential to its daily operation and sustainable development. However, Hong Kong currently has two freshwater sources, local yield and DJ water, both of which are vulnerable to climate change impacts. In case of severe droughts, we may not able to meet the 99% reliability requirement.

Hong Kong's fresh water and salt water supplies are provided through a network of about 7 800 kilometres of water mains. Most of these water mains are underground with some portion being laid more than 30 years ago.  Such water mains are progressively approaching the end of their service life and have become increasingly difficult and costly to maintain. Therefore, the timescale for the risk will be “Medium term”.
